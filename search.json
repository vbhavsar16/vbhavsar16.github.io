    "text": "The recommendation engine uses the data of the users and product items. First, we will look at the simplest data which does not have any features associated with either users or items.\n\nThe cells can be populated with the various information collected, for example, binary (buy/no buy, play/not played, watched/not watched, bookmarked/not bookmarked) or discrete (ratings, total watch time, percentage of video watched).\n\n\nThere are two types of recommendation engines. 1. Collaborative based filtering 2. Content based filtering\n\n\nThe collaborative filtering is also called matrix completion. The simplest example for this type of algorithm is Similarity based algorithm.\nLet‚Äôs see an example of this algorithm\n#\nFor other types of algorithm, we need to first look at Matrix Factorization"
